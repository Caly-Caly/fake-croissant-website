    <p>
      Croissants are crescent-shaped pastries made of a yeast dough similar to
      puff pastry. They are a buttery, flaky pastry that is delicately sweet.
      The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in
      succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called
      laminating. The name “croissant” comes from the French word for “crescent”
      or “crescent of the moon”, despite them originating from Australia.
